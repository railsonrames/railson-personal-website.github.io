I’m a software developer with over 10 years of experience, currently focused on the .NET development platform. I've contributed to large-scale enterprise and government projects through well-known consulting firms like Accenture and, most recently, Capgemini Engineering. My work has spanned sectors such as road infrastructure, public works, military systems, government digital certification, banking, IoT, real estate, and delivery services.

I approach my work with professionalism, responsibility, and a constant drive to improve. I value clear communication, strong collaboration, and delivering quality solutions while maintaining a balanced and sustainable workflow.

Over the years, I’ve also taken part in onboarding and knowledge-sharing initiatives, which strengthened my role as a technical mentor and opened opportunities to develop structured training content. My experience with software requirements and visual design allows me to bridge the gap between technical teams, clients, and design or marketing departments.

If you’re looking for a fullstack or backend developer who combines solid technical delivery with adaptability and strong team integration, I’d be glad to connect.
